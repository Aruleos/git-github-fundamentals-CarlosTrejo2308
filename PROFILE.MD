
### About me...
Good evenning everyone, my name is Carlos Leos, I'am 27 years old and I'm really glad to meet you this semester and to my teacher, hope I could make it this time. 

### Things I would love to learn...
I'm interested in learning new languages, python and developing games, the first one is my favourite because one day I'll know one language from every continent, in fact I know a little bit of english and some german phrases.

### Hobbies
Another thing that I love is playing volleyball is one of my biggest hobbies, reading and working out as well.

So thanks and have a nice day.
